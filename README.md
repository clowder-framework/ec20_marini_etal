2. Follow these steps to run the notebook on your local machine:

- Install python 3 on your local machine (you can try anaconda for managing your environments)
- Create a virtual environment and install the `requirements.txt`
- Install Jupyter Notebook in the same virtual environment from the previous step
- Run the notebook `ecgs.ipynb` using `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook`.

A PDF copy of the notebook is available [here](ecgs.pdf).
